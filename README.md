# PyStoneGame

PyStoneGame is a simple console-based two-player strategy game implemented in Python. The game board consists of a square grid, and players take turns moving their stones to adjacent empty spaces. The objective is to lock the opponent's stones between two of the player's own stones, thereby capturing and removing them from the board.

## How to Play:

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the size of the playing field (4x4 to 8x8).
3. Choose characters to represent Player 1 and Player 2.
4. Players take turns making moves by specifying the source and destination positions (e.g., "1C 2C").
5. Stones are locked and removed if an opponent's stone is trapped between two of the player's stones.

## Features:

- Dynamic grid size (4x4 to 8x8).
- Customizable player characters.
- Intelligent stone locking mechanism.
- Winner declaration when one player has less than 2 stones remaining.
